This is an alternative portfolio written on Next.js, and we used TypeScript for typing.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## What I've used ?

Next.js (React Framework)

TypeScript (typing)

Tailwind CSS (styles)
